Based on measurements the timing is:

1) When the serial break starts (~ 2ms) the PICAXE being programmed starts responding immediately (1 millisecond or less)
2) The response takes approxiately 136 milliseconds to complete
3) When the serial break ends, the PICAXE waits approximately 5 seconds before it stops listening for programming instructions.
4) Normally The PICAXE programmer responds within about 1400 ms
